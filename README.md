# NBA_Stat_Analysis
The idea behind this project is to look over a dataset of NBA players and determine which combination of players are the best at specific stats strategies.

# Important Note
No data will be accessible on this repository, only the way of analyzing the data.  Also, this project is purely an educational project, the idea being of trying to find out which stats are the most important stats to focus on when forming an NBA draft tean.  No profit is made from this product.

# Strategy
This repository is meant to be only a part of our analysis.  The idea is simply to analyze each player against a set of weights assigned to specific stat lines.  Currently, this uses the default scoring system (similar to what DraftKings use).  Then we can sort the list of players by their score and find the best 2-guard, 2-forward, center combination to find our best 5 player team.
